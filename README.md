# MSc-Machine-Learning-UCL Projects
This repository contains the projects done during my UCL MSc Machine Learning course

Folder content:

СОМР0078CW1 - First coursework for the module СОМР0078 Supervised Learning. In this coursework I implement polynomial regression, kernel ridge regression, k-nearest-neighbours and analyze them from a theoretical point of view.

СОМР0163CW1 - First coursework for the module СОМР0163 Blockchain Technologies. In this coursework I implement a smart contract in DAML "DAMLCW.pdf" (an open-source smart contract language) as well as a smart contract in Solidity "SmartContract.sol", "SolCW.pdf".
